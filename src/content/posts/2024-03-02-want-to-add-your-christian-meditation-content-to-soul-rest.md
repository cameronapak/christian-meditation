I am so thankful for the Body of Christ coming together to give away free
resources of Christian meditations and meditative prayers.

There are so many wonderful organizations and ministries who want to help you
have peace of heart and mind in Jesus and rest for your souls.

Here are some verses that are the main reasons on why Soul Rest exists:

> Philippians 4:6-7 - "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation,
> by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And
> the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts
> and your minds in Christ Jesus."

> Isaiah 26:3 - "You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast,
> because they trust in you."

> Romans 15:13: "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you
> trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy
> Spirit."

> John 3:30 - "He must become greater; I must become less."

> Psalm 91:1-2: "Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the
> shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, ‘He is my refuge and my
> fortress, my God, in whom I trust.’"
