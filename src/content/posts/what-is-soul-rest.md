Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Life can be hard sometimes...

Oh and, life can be hard oftentimes.

## What do you do when life gets hard?

What do you do when sickness comes? When nothing seems to be going right? When
you are hurting?

I learned that Godly community and to learning to be still with God can be so
healing and strengthening.

> Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me
> and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with
> me and work with me - watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace.
> I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and
> you'll learn to live freely and lightly. (Matthew 11:28-30 MSG)

## Sometimes you need Soul Rest

When I was at the peak of my chronic sickness, Christian meditations based on
the Bible, Way of Jesus, and connecting deeply with God, were the tools that
helped bring peace to the storm.

I could be in the hardest point in my life but still be able to breathe lightly
because I was learning to be content and be still, with God.

That's when I found the power of Biblically-based Christian meditations and
meditative prayers. Those tools helped me find joy and connection with God in
the hardest time of my life.

I learned that God is enough. He is what you need.
