Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Life can be hard sometimes...

Oh and, life can be hard oftentimes. 

## What do you do when life gets hard?

What do you do when sickness comes? When nothing seems to be going right? When you are hurting?

I learned that Godly community and to learning to be still with God can be so healing and strengthening.

> Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me - watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me and you'll learn to live freely and lightly. (Matthew 11:28-30 MSG)

## Sometimes you need Soul Rest

When I was at the peak of my chronic sickness, Christian meditations based on the Bible, Way of Jesus, and connecting deeply with God, were the tools that helped bring peace to the storm.

I could be in the hardest point in my life but still be able to breathe lightly because I was learning to be content and be still, with God. 

God is enough.

He is what you need.
