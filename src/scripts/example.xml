      <description><![CDATA[<p>When we hear God speak to us about gifts He has given us, it’s easy to be a bit skeptical. We might doubt that we have gifts at all—at least of any significance. We live in a world that ranks gifts based on wealth, social status, power. So it can be easy to look around and feel like what we have to offer isn’t much. But that’s not what God feels out about us. That’s not what God thinks.</p> <p>Holy Spirit offers us a different perspective. Our unique personalities, our quirks, our ways of being in this world—these are our gifts. And they allow us to experience—and express—God’s love.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we hear God speak to us about gifts He has given us, it’s easy to be a bit skeptical. We might doubt that we have gifts at all—at least of any significance.
